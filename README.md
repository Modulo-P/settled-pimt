# Incremental Merkle Tree

This is an implementation of the incremental Merkle tree in Aiken. The incremental Merkle tree is a data structure that provides efficient and secure data verification and storage. It is a variant of the traditional Merkle tree, which is a cryptographic structure composed of a binary tree of hash values. In the incremental version, the tree can be updated dynamically by adding new leaves without the need to rebuild the entire structure.
